## DR-0000 Use decision records to document decisions

*#decision*

Status: Approved \
Date: 2025-06-08

### Decision

To document the values, structure, architecture and of the project, we will use decision records to document
**why** things are the way they are, and what alternatives have been considered.

### Context

Source code mostly conveys the **How** of a solution, but is often insufficient to explain the **Why** behind it,
and usually never the *alternatives* that were considered, but ultimately rejected.

A lack of understanding of these "Why's" can lead to incorrect assumptions, duplicate effort, inconsistent
structures and behaviors, as well as an overall lack of vision.

### Consequences

For all major decisions, we will use decision records to document them.

These decision records will be checked in to the source control repository.

The decision records should be written in a way that is clear, concise and easy to understand.

The format should be:

> Title: DR-{sequential number} {title}\
> Status: {Decisions status, one of: In Progress, Approved, Rejected, Superseded}\
> Date: {Date of last update in YYYY-MM-DD format}
>
> ### Decision

> {What alternatives were considered? Why were they rejected?}

### Considered Alternatives

#### Not documenting decisions

Not documenting decisions seemed like a bad idea for a documentation tool:

The reasoning and considerations behind these issues and decisions would not be published a available to other
interested parties.

#### Using architecture decision records (ADRs)

These decision records were originally intended for architecture decisions.

However, there seemed no good reason to restrict this process to architecture decisions only.

This would mean excluding other relevant decisions, such as those related to the development process, or even
non-technical decisions.
