# Gall's Law

**Statement:** "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system."

**Proposed by:** John Gall (1975)

**Key Insight:** Successful complex systems grow from simple, working systems, not from complex initial designs.

**Implications:**
- Start with the simplest possible working version
- Complex systems should evolve incrementally
- Big Design Up Front (BDUF) often leads to failure
- Agile methodologies align well with this principle
- Refactoring is a natural part of system growth
