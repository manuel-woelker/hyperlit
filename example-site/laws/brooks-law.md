# Brooks's Law

**Statement:** "Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later."

**Proposed by:** Fred Brooks (1975)

**Key Insight:** There is an inherent overhead in adding new people to a project due to the time required for them to get up to speed and the increased
communication overhead.

**Implications:**

- Throwing more developers at a late project can slow it down initially
- The cost of training and communication increases with team size
- Better to focus on improving existing team productivity than just adding more people
