# Hofstadter's Law

**Statement:** "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law."

**Proposed by:** Douglas Hofstadter (1979)

**Key Insight:** Time estimation in complex projects is inherently difficult, and humans consistently underestimate the time required.

**Examples:**
- Software development projects
- Research work
- Creative endeavors
- Home renovation projects

**Implications:**
- The recursive nature of the law highlights the difficulty of accurate time estimation
- Suggests that all time estimates should include significant buffers
- Explains why projects are often late even when accounting for potential delays
- A humorous take on the planning fallacy
