# Conway's Law

**Statement:** "Organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."

**Proposed by:** Melvin Conway (1967)

**Key Insight:** The structure of a system will mirror the structure of the organization that built it. This means that how teams are organized and communicate will be reflected in the software architecture.

**Example:** If you have four teams working on a compiler, you'll likely end up with a 4-pass compiler.

**Implications:** 
- To change system design, you may need to change team structure
- Cross-functional teams can lead to more modular and decoupled systems
- Communication patterns in the organization will be reflected in system architecture
