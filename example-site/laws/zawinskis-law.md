# Zawinski's Law

**Statement:** "Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can."

**Proposed by:** Jamie Zawinski (1990s)

**Also Known As:** The Law of Software Envelopment

**Key Insight:** Software tends to accumulate features until it includes email capabilities, or gets replaced by software that does.

**Examples:**
- Web browsers started as document viewers, now include email clients
- Operating systems now bundle email clients
- Even development tools often include messaging/notification systems

**Implications:**
- Feature creep is a natural tendency in software
- Successful software often becomes a platform
- The line between different types of applications continues to blur
