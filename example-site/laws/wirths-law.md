**Statement:** "Software gets slower faster than hardware gets faster."

**Proposed by:** Niklaus Wirth (1995)

**Key Insight:** Despite hardware improvements, software tends to become slower and more resource-hungry over time.

**Implications:**
- Explains why software doesn't necessarily get faster with better hardware
- Highlights the issue of software bloat
- Emphasizes the importance of optimization and efficient coding
- Suggests that software often expands to consume available resources
