# Moore's Law

**Statement:** The number of transistors on a microchip doubles about every two years, though the cost of computers is halved.

**Proposed by:** Gordon Moore (1965)

**Key Insight:** Computing power tends to increase exponentially over time while relative cost decreases.

**Implications:**
- Rapid advancement in computing capabilities
- Shorter hardware refresh cycles
- Enables new technologies and applications
- Physical limitations may eventually slow or end this trend
