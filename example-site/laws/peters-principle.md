# The Peter Principle

**Statement:** "In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to their level of incompetence."

**Proposed by:** Laurence J. Peter (1969)

**Key Insight:** People are promoted based on their current performance until they reach a position where they're no longer competent, and there they stay.

**Implications:**
- Explains why so many workplaces seem to be run by incompetent people
- Suggests that good performance in one job doesn't predict performance in a different role
- Highlights the importance of proper training and support when promoting employees
- Has led to the development of alternative career progression models
